<a id="approach-and-methodology" class="anchor" href="#approach-and-methodology" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Approach and Methodology:</h1>

<p>At the beginning I was given a data file that contained all the tweets from August 2015, and Facebook comments between Aug. 2014 and Aug. 2015 in regards to certain banks that were named BankA, BankB, BankC, and BankD. The file contained exactly 220377 combined entries. To better condense the data I loaded the data into an excel spreadsheet and formatted it so that I would be able to manipulate the data. From there I removed all entries that did not have at least one of the banks mentioned, as their data would be irrelevant. I then refined the data by deleting all the columns except the fulltext column so I could focus on only the texts. From there I copied the sheet four times and in each copy and filtered and deleted any data posts that did not concern each respective bank so that I was left with four files that each contained entries only about their respective bank.</p>

<p>Now that I had my data condensed and formatted I began by analyzing the banks as a whole. I wanted to see what topics people were talking about in these posts. So I found the word frequency of all of the banks combined of terms that appeared at least 3000 times. From these terms I found and listed all the words that are topics that are financially related. I found the amount of positive and negative posts about each term. I then converted that number into a percentage for each term. This would show the percentage of positive and negative posts that each term had in relation to all the posts. I presented these in 2 histograms. I then did this same process but to each separate bank so that I could see how much percentage each bank contributed to the overall percentages that I had just found. I presented these findings in 2 stacked bar graphs.

<p>According to the data I gathered from my approach and methodology, I could find several relationships between the frequency of vocabulary used and social conversation topics. The frequently used terms that were financially related were “Account”, “Card”, “Credit”, “Deposit”, “Fee”, “Finance”, “Loan”, “Money”, “Mortgage”, and “Service.” All of these terms are in financially related topics linked to banks. These topics will be analyzed later in this report however, these words/topics are a great indication of how people perceive banks in general or their own specific bank on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Many people today are focused and worried about how they are going to pay for their college education. A lot of people may not know what they are going to do. In an effort to help educate students, parents, and families on best practices for planning and preparing for college, one of the four banks analyzed created a page on their website to accomplish this. They called the initiative “Get College Ready” and they created the hashtag #GetCollegeReady to go along with it in order to increase social media use of it. The term “GetCollgeReady” was mentioned at least 3000 times and appeared in the list of terms and the previously mentioned explanation behind it explains why it appeared in my term list. This term appearing my data shows how the data is connected to the ongoing social topics and drivers at the time they were collected.</p>

<a id="the-code" class="anchor" href="#the-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Code</h1>

<p>All of the work to condense the data and format it was done in excel where I then saved several text files for each format that I wanted to read. All of those files and workbooks are included in the attachments that came with this report.</p>

<a id="r-code" class="anchor" href="#r-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>R Code:</h2>

<ul>
<li>FinalScript.R includes code to get term frequency from terms that appear at least 3000 times, shown in histogram.</li>
<li>score.sentiment() function uses laply() to iterate through the input text. It strips punctuation and control characters from each line using R’s regular expression-powered substitution function, gsub(), and uses match() against each word list to find matches; taken from (<a href="http://www.inside-r.org/howto/mining-twitter-airline-consumer-sentiment">http://www.inside-r.org/howto/mining-twitter-airline-consumer-sentiment</a>) utilizes Hu and Liu's "opinion lexicon," which categorizes words as positive or negative found at (<a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/%7Eliub/FBS/opinion-lexicon-English.rar">http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/opinion-lexicon-English.rar</a>)</li>
<li>FinalScript.R also includes the code that gives all the sentiment scores and their percentages for all the banks combined as well as each individual bank to be displayed in histograms and stacked bar graphs.

<h2>
<a id="word-frequency" class="anchor" href="#word-frequency" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Word Frequency</h2>

<p>I will begin with the top financially related terms that appears at least 3000 times. The terms were “Account”, “Card”, “Credit”, “Deposit”, “Fee”, “Finance”, “Loan”, “Money”, “Mortgage”, and “Service.” Their term frequencies are supported by histogram of the word frequency as is shown in Figure 1.

<h2>
<a id="overall-percentages" class="anchor" href="#overall-percentages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overall Percentages</h2>

<p>The overall amount of positive posts for each term was outnumbered by the amount of negative posts of each term except for three terms: Credit, Fee, and Finance. In other words all of terms except for these three had positive percentages below 50% with negative percentages being above 50%, meaning that they had more negative posts posted about them, while the aforementioned terms had positive percentages above 50% with negative percentages being below 50%, meaning that they had more positive posts than negative posts. These findings can be seen in figure 2 and figure 3.<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/uguEjFf.png" alt="Figure 2">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/fkCSzaT.png" alt="Figure 3">
After seeing these percentages and making these observations I wondered how these percentages were broken down. I wanted to know how much of each percentage did each bank contribute both positive and negative.</p>

<h1>

<h2>
<a id="account" class="anchor" href="#account" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Account</h2>

<p>For the term “Account” I found that Bank A contributed the greatest amount of positive posts while Bank B contributed the greatest amount of negative posts. This observation clearly tells me that while overall the banks amount of negative posts outnumbered the positive posts, Bank B’s posts about the topic “Account” were the worst while Bank A’s were the best. However Bank A’s number of negative posts still outnumbered its amount positive posts despite Bank A being the greatest positive post contributor.</p>

<h2>
<a id="card-money-credit-and-fee" class="anchor" href="#card-money-credit-and-fee" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Card, Money, Credit, and Fee</h2>

<p>Bank B had some interesting patterns. For the terms “Card” and “Money” (“Money” having the highest negative percentage out of all the terms) Bank B contributed the greatest to both the positive and negative percentages but its negative percentages outnumbered its positive percentages. Bank B did almost the same thing for the terms “Credit” and “Fee” except its positive percentages outnumbered its negative percentages. Also “Fee” had the greatest positive percentage overall as well as contained Bank B’s highest positive percentage overall. “Credit” contained Bank C’s highest positive and highest negative percentages overall.</p>

<h2>
<a id="deposit" class="anchor" href="#deposit" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deposit</h2>

<p>For the term “Deposit” Bank A contributed the highest positive percentage and Bank B contributed the highest negative percentage. Nothing particularly interesting or significant occurred with this term.</p>

<h1>
<a id="finance" class="anchor" href="#finance" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Finance</h1>

<p>Bank D had many things happen for the term “Finance.” Bank D contributed the greatest amount to both positive and negative percentages. While “Finance” contained Bank D’s highest positive and highest negative percentages overall, its negative percentage outnumbered its positive percentage.</p>

<h2>
<a id="loan" class="anchor" href="#loan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Loan</h2>

<p>For the term “Loan” Bank A contributed the greatest to both negative and positive percentages however its negative percentage outnumbered its positive percentage.</p>

<h2>
<a id="mortgage" class="anchor" href="#mortgage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mortgage</h2>

<p>For the term “Mortgage” Bank A contributed amount of positive percentage while Bank B contributed the greatest amount of negative percentage. “Mortgage” also contained both Bank A’s highest positive percentage overall as well as Bank B’s greatest negative percentage overall.</p>

<h2>
<a id="service" class="anchor" href="#service" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Service</h2>

<p>Lastly for the term “Service” Bank A contributed the greatest positive percentage and Bank B contributed the greatest negative percentage. However, Bank A’s negative percentage outnumbered its positive percentage. Also the term “Service” contained Bank A’s highest negative percentage overall. All of the observations made above can be backed by the graphs in figures 4 and 5. Figure 4 Figure 5

<h2>
<a id="marketing" class="anchor" href="#marketing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Marketing</h2>

<p>In the statements above I simply made observations. Nothing was particularly analytical. However, after some thought I found that there could be some potential uses for the data such as marketing. After showing each banks percentages on each topic, each bank could go and look at what people like the most about them and start marketing that term. Once they begin marketing that topic people will start to back up their claims because they already do and this could lead more people to each bank.</p>

<h2>
<a id="improvements" class="anchor" href="#improvements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Improvements</h2>

<p>Another use for this information could be improvements. Each bank now knows what people think about them and they dislike the most about each bank. The banks could look at the data and see what areas and topics they could improve on to drive more positive posts made about them.</p>
